This is a demo project for Elixir in Action.

To be able to compile and run it, you'll need Elixir 1.0.0 and Erlang 17.0.
A `git` client should also be installed
and available somewhere in the execution path.

Prior to the first build, you need to call `mix deps.get`.
After that, you can build and start the interactive shell
by running `iex -S mix` from this project root.
